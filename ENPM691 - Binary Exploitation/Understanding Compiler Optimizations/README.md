# Analyzing Compiler Optimization for Constant Multiplication

## Abstract
This assignment explores how varying constant values affect assembly code generation for multiplication, focusing on compiler optimizations and debugging techniques. By examining a C program that multiplies integers by different constants, we gain insights into how compilers generate optimized machine code using techniques like bitwise shifts and arithmetic operations. The study enhances understanding of low-level code generation and debugging through assembly analysis.
